By now you should have finished step 1, and you should be ready to move onto step 2.  

THE PROBLEM:

Here is the exact thing from USACO training:

dave	laura	owen	vick	amr
 0	    0	    0 	  0 	 0
First, 'dave' splits 200 among 'laura', 'owen', and 'vick'. That comes to 66 each, with 2 left over
200+2	 +66	 +66	 +66	 0

-198	66	66	66	0

As you can see, dave had 2 dollars left over, and that had to be refunded to him.  We don't have this in our code yet.
***IMPORTANT***
For this step use the modulo(%) sign.  For example 8 % 3 = 2 as 2*3 = 6 and 6 + 2 = 8(basically 2 is the remainder of the equation)
Are you having trouble?
