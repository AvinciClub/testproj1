I'm going to make this really straight-forward for you:
We have a dictionary named "names", but we don't have the order.  QUOTE:
"
The names should be printed in the same order they appear starting on line 2 of the input.
"
The only problem is that dictionaries don't have orders.  Lists do.

Your code:
names = {}

with open('gift1.in') as fin: 
    num = int(fin.readline())
    for _ in range(num):
        names[fin.readline().rstrip()] = 0
    rawtransactions = fin.readlines()
    
You need to replace names with a list called order(or something else), and then make a dictionary off that list.

Pretty much, just change the dictionary adding on things to a list.  After that, use this code to make the dictoinary:
names = {i: 0 for i in order}

Confused?

When you print out your answer, just us this(assuming you made the list's name order and the dictionary's name names):

with open('gift1.out', 'w') as fout:
    for i in order:
        print('%s %d' % (i, names[i]), file=fout)
