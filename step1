So here are the steps you will need to finish your python program(gift1):

Your program currently has a bug.  When givemoney == True:, this adds money to the people next(as it should), but it has the following bug:
For example, when you want to add money to three people, the program is runs as the following steps:

check for looping:
  (it is not 0)
  
add to the person.

looping -= 1 (looping is currently 3, after this statement it is 2)
...
check for looping:
  (it is not 0)
  
add to the person.

looping -= 1 (looping is currently 2, after this statement it is 1)
...
check for looping:
  (it is not 0)

add to the person.

looping -= 1 (looping is currently 1, after this statement it is 0)

THIS IS THREE TIMES ALREADY, BUT CHECK DOES NOT REALIZE:
(here we go again)

check for looping:
  (its 0, but it doesn't stop as the if statement has already ran)

add to the person.

looping -= 1 (looping is currently 0, after this statement it is -1)

Now it will finally stop.  However, this has ran 4 times, and it has added this money the next person(which was trying to do a transaction)
Are you having trouble?
